          In the early nineteen-forties, decades before he was Stan the Man, the
          impresario of the Marvel Universe, Stanley Martin Lieber fetched
          coffee, took notes, and sat on desks playing the piccolo—or perhaps
          the ocarina—in the offices of his uncle’s comic-book company. There,
          before and after his Army service, and into the decade that followed,
          Stanley became one of many typists and scribblers providing copy for
          word balloons and prose for the books’ filler pages. He was as
          efficient as his older colleagues at churning out scripts, and already
          distinguished himself in one way: he put his pen name, Stan Lee, on
          all his work. He said that he was saving his birth name for a more
          respectable project, like a novel. Still, if he was going to make
          comics, he wanted credit. That desire served him well. It also raised
          big questions about—to use two of Lee’s favorite nouns—power and
          responsibility, since Lee never created a comic alone. Novelists have
          editors and publishers. Live-action films require directors and
          actors. And company-owned superhero comics are plotted, drawn,
          scripted, and lettered by different people, with creative teams that
          change over time. To give a full account of Stan Lee, as Abraham
          Riesman sets out to do in a new biography, “True Believer” (Crown), is
          to contend not just with his presence in popular culture (the smiling
          oldster in sunglasses, with a cameo in each Marvel film) but with the
          fluid nature of artistic collaboration, and so with endless debates
          over which parts of the comics are his. In the early nineteen-forties,
